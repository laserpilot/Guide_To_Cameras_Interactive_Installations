## High End Machine Vision Cameras

\[NEED IMAGE]

These cameras are typically employed in industries like manufacturing that require a high degree of stability and performance for performing computer vision tasks.

One example would be the use of cameras and specialized software to monitor a fast moving automated assembly line and using the visual data to ensure every product looks correct. They can also be employed for things like processing produce - sorting ripe tomatoes from green tomatoes at very high speeds.

This area of cameras is incredibly complex and we won't go into all of the specifics here, but you should definitely be aware that these specialized systems exist. The most common ones you will probably come across have already been mentioned, like machine vision infrared or thermal cameras. most of them range from having standard interfaces like USB and GigE, to proprietary cables and PCI cards for maximum data speed and low latency.
