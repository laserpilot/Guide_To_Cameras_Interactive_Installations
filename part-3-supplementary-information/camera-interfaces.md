Another important thing to keep in mind is that while many artistically geared software environments do work off-the-shelf with various cameras and input types (typically with [UVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB\_video\_device\_class), more exotic cameras aren't always plug and play. Make sure you do your research before making a big purchase. If the tool doesn't exist to pull in a video feed, there are a few technologies that can route video between applications or even over the network. The most common tools are [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info) for macOS and [Spout](https://spout.zeal.co) for Windows, but there are other options out there as well.
