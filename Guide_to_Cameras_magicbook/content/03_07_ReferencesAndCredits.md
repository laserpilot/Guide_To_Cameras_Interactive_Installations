Huge thanks to [Elliot Woods](http://elliotwoods.info) for a ton of thoughtful suggestions on how to expand  the guide from its 2013 version. [Kyle McDonald](http://kylemcdonald.net), [Theo Watson](http://theowatson.com/), <a href="http://thesystemis.com/">Zach Lieberman</a> and <a href="http://www.flong.com/">Golan Levin</a> for some great additional tips to help round out some of the suggestions here.

To-do for 2020 Update:

- Clean up language and links
- Publish a version to Medium/personal site?
- Update references to various camera technologies in all categories
- Reference different connection protocols now available or more common (HDMI Capture, NDI, IP Cameras, GigE)
- Webcam update technologies (Logitech Brio)
- Other RGB Cameras (PTZ, 4K, DSLR, Broadcast)
- Major depth camera update (Kinect Azure, Orbbec, Realsense, include [Stimulant Depth camera shootout link](https://stimulant.com/depth-sensor-shootout-2/), [GigE Realsense](https://imaging.framos.com/cpc/en/d435e/?keyword=Realsense+GigE+Camera&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsqmywIPU5wIViJOzCh2NZQYsEAAYASAAEgIg7fD_BwE)   
- Thermal camera update (portable cams, USB, cheaper)
- High Speed cameras (Edgertronic, ix cameras, phantom)
- Others? (Leap Motion, GoPro, motion capture systems, things like Blacktrak(https://blacktrax.cast-soft.com) ), other things to consider as cameras or "observational tracking devices"
- Older camera technologies (DVCam, RCA/Analog, "Analog" capture devices, etc)
- Experimental
- Maybe more general tips outside of specific camera technologies? Suggestions below from Elliot
- Monochrome advantages
- USB3 vs GigE
- Lenses
- Noise and Noise reduction
- Machine learning touchup (upscaling, noise reduction, low light)
- Using a smartphone camera (pros, cons, intgerated sensor data and intrinsics)
- High end machine vision cams
