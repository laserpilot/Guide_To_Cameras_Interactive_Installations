# Motion capture and XR systems

These could have their own article and I have limited experience with them, but they are worth adding to the list for completeness. Motion capture systems are primarily used to capture the movements of performers that are then mapped to the skeletons of 3D models, essentiall puppeteering them. Motion capture systems can be camera-based or non-camera-based (like a suit covered in IMU's or inertial measurement units like the [Xsens](https://www.xsens.com)). We'll just cover the basic camera-based systems here.
