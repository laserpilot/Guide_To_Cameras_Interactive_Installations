# Older Camera/Video Technologies (Analog, Old RCA Cams)

The use cases for older camera technologies are much more rare and may only come up on certain productions that require the analog aesthetic in a way that can't be recreated with real time visual effects.

It would be a large research project to dive into all of the older technologies, but we'll just stick with some noteable ones. 

Old consumer video cameras and security cameras are probably the most likely candidates for use. Their resolution is fairly low

The biggest advantage that analog cameras used to have over their digital counterparts is that their latency from lens to screen was much lower because there weren't added layers of digital to analog conversion.
