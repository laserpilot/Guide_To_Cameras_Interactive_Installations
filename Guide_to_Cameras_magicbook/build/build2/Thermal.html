<p>These cameras are comparatively rare to see in use in interactive installations because they are still prohibitively expensive compared to most other ones. They aren&apos;t totally unobtainable ( roughly 1000-20000USD) but that higher price tag makes them a little less&#xA0;desirable&#xA0;for early exploration on projects. It&apos;s a shame because these cameras offer a lot of abilities that just aren&apos;t possible with the other kinds of cameras.</p>
<p>There are various types of cameras to look at in this class, mostly pertaining to which part of the IR spectrum you&apos;re trying to see. You have the option of Long Wave IR, Mid Wave IR, and Short Wave IR. For thermal imaging, you&apos;ll mostly want to work with Long Wave IR, in the 7000-14000nm range.</p>
<p>I have not personally used one of these cameras yet, but they have some properties that would be really amazing in the tool belt of people making interactive installations.</p>
<p>Check out this guy doing some random demos with a thermal camera:</p>

<p><strong>Connection types:</strong> Most are made to be integrated into existing systems and either have proprietary connections or just output composite video. <a href="http://www.thermitrack.com/">Some cameras communicate X/Y position of blobs.</a></p>
<p><strong>Resolution range:</strong> Some are very low resolution (the Thermitrack is 16 x 16px) and some are close to a VGA range, but don&apos;t expect to find HD thermal for cheap. You also get a variety of frame rates and contrast ranges.</p>
<p><strong>Thermal Camera Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Normal visible light doesn&apos;t have much of an effect on a thermal camera.</li>
<li>Good for tracking a large area like a stage.</li>
<li>Gives you the ability to more definitely identify people because of their heat signature...whereas other objects and materials may not show up at all if they are warmer.</li>
<li>Fairly robust for daytime to night time interaction because people will be the same temperature and appear in the proper dynamic range.</li>
<li>Give you the ability to track invisible phenomena like hot air from breath, or residual heat from something like a hand leaving a warm mark on a surface, or a cold blast of water hitting a warm surface.</li>
<li>Can see through certain materials and walls.</li>
<li>Thermal cameras can see through certain kinds of clothing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thermal Camera Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As these are&#xA0;occasionally considered military grade equipment, there may be export restrictions, so be wary when planning on traveling abroad.</li>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>Difficult to integrate - require either custom electronics or capture hardware</li>
<li>Thermal cameras can see through certain kinds of clothing.</li>
<li>Not all lights are invisible to thermal cameras...if it&apos;s producing heat or radiating it, the camera will see it.</li>
<li>Thermal imaging sometimes results in ghosting of movement due to the sensor method.</li>
<li>They are unable to see through windows/glass because the range of radiation ends up being reflected before it transmits through the glass to the camera. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081001100003AAH2Ouo">See here for a more involved explanation of why</a>.</li>
<li>Certain hot materials may result in unforeseen&#xA0;difficulties&#xA0;with using thermal imaging in certain environments. Requires a different type of thinking in order to anticipate things that will be overly hot or cold in the space of the installation.</li>
</ul>
