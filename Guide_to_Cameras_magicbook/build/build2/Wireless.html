<p>Wireless is a bit of a misnomer since almost any camera can be made wireless these days, and obviously even smartphone cameras count as a wireless camera. These would most commonly be used on film shoots for drones or remote monitoring by a director, but there may be limited usage for certain kinds of interactive installations and events. This technology is more about the interface that sends the image signal more than the actual image capture, so there isn&apos;t a ton to cover here.</p>
<p>There are several devices out there for connecting any camera to a wireless interface that can stream the signal to a nearby computer over wifi, or over the internet via an integrated 4G/5G interface. The primary issues that will get introduced with wireless systems are: reliability, increased latency, and signal degredation as a side effect of video compression. Also - battery life is another beast to manage.</p>
<p>Professional Wireless camera interfaces to investigate include:</p>

</ul>
<p>On the low end of cost for experimentation, smartphone cameras can be wirelessly streamed to desktop computers via various streaming apps. GoPro cameras are another classic consumer wireless camera that can be interfaced with. There are also a range of battery powered <a href="https://www.safewise.com/blog/best-wireless-security-cameras/">security cameras</a> that may be the right choice depending on your application.
For other resources, you can also look for devices marketed for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-wireless-hdmi-video-transmitter/">wirelessly sending HDMI</a> and RCA video signals instead of devices geared specifically towards making cameras wireless.</p>
<p>Some wireless systems rely on existing wifi or other tradiitonal network infrastructure, and some generate and receive their own wireless signals. Many of them promise the ability to send signals over very long distances - like 750 to 1500ft (~230-460m) and up to <a href="https://teradek.com/collections/bolt-4k-max-series">5000ft</a> (about 1.5km). I would take those distance estimate with a grain of salt as they often require line of sight and very little interference, and reliable Wifi is always a weakpoint on many productions.</p>
