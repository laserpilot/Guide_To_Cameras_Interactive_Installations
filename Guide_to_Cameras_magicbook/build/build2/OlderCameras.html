<p>The use cases for older camera technologies are much more rare and may only come up on certain productions that require the analog aesthetic in a way that can&apos;t be recreated with real time visual effects.</p>
<p>It would be a large research project to dive into all of the older technologies, but we&apos;ll just stick with some noteable ones.</p>
<p>Old consumer video cameras and security cameras are probably the most likely candidates for use. Their resolution is fairly low</p>
<p>The biggest advantage that analog cameras used to have over their digital counterparts is that their latency from lens to screen was much lower because there weren&apos;t added layers of digital to analog conversion.</p>
