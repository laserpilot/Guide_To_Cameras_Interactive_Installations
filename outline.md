# Outline



In the sections below, Part 1 covers several common camera types and their strengths and weaknesses. Following that, Part 2 will cover some less common cameras and other topics like camera systems that use hybrid approaches. Part 3 will cover some supplementary information like camera measurements, latency, and other brief software topics. Here is an outline of what we'll be covering.
